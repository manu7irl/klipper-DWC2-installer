# klipper-DWC2-installer
to streamline the install or upgrade of KLIPPER &amp; DWC2 front-end for it. 
with these 2 together no need to use octoprint.
I run mine on orangepi zero with H2+ CPU 512MB and it works nicely.
to run it:
```git clone https://github.com/manu7irl/klipper-DWC2-installer
```cd klipper-DWC2-installer
```./klipper-dwc2-installer.sh
you will be presented to an interactive menu to install or update your system.
